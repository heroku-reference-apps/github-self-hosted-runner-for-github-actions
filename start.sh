# In bash, the way to "catch" an exception is with `trap` command.

#
# `INT` refers to SIGINT status code, the process interrupted at the terminal (Ctrl+C)
# `TERM` refers to SIGTERM status code, the process was told to shutdown.
#
# POSIX systems return a status code as a number, which is 128 + N
# where N is the value of the actual error.
#
# SIGINT has a value of 2, so the exit code is 130 (128+2).
# SIGTERM has a value of 15, so the exit code is 143 (128+15).

# Normally, bash will ignore any signals while a child process is executing.
# Starting the server with & (single ampersand) will background it into the
# shell's job control system, with `$!` holding the server's PID.
#
# Calling `wait` will then wait for the job with the specified PID (the server)
# to finish, or for any signals to be fired.
#
# For more on shell signal handling along with `wait`, review this Stack Exchange answer
# https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/146756/forward-sigterm-to-child-in-bash/146770#146770
#
# Also note that we are invoking runsvc.sh and not run.sh because the runner
# program self-updates (no way to disable it) and according to online discussions
# the service script should handle the update and keep the processing running
# rather than shutting down and becoming a zombie runner that won't run jobs.
